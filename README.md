<h3>This is an application used to help locate... um... cookie stores.</h3>

<p>Because cookies are delicious. And they make you feel so good.<p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:2px solid #000;">Guidlines:</h3>
Plot out what we're looking for in an application and we can set a time frame (if we want) which will in turn help us with project management.
<ul>
<li>What language? AngularJS? Angular2? ASP.Net? Pure JavaScript? something else?</li>
<li>What design? CSS> Bootstrap 3? Bootstrap 4? SASS?</li>
<li>What about a templated JavaScript library? Ionic? REACT? <a src="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711">JAVASCRIPT STUFF!</a></li>
<li>What editor will we use? Notepad++? Brackets? NetBeans? something else?</li>
<li>What mapping agent will we use? Google? Bing? MapQuest? something else?</li>
<li>How will we divvy up the work? Who does what?</li>
</ul>

<h3>End goal:</h3>
<p>To have an application that can bring up local "cookie stores" on a map based off location.</p>
